# üé® My Xcode theme - Palenight Hoyelam

This repository contains the Xcode theme that I use. 
The Xcode theme is inspired by [Palenigh Theme](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=whizkydee.material-palenight-theme) and [Material Theme](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=Equinusocio.vsc-material-theme) for Visual Studio Code. 
I made some modifications to it to my tasting. Feel free to use it or modify it to your liking üëç.
